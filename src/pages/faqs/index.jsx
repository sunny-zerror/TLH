          We treat your clothes like assets.

In the unlikely event of damage, we have a transparent <strong> Claims Resolution Process </strong> based on the age and value of the garment, ensuring you are never left without an answer.

        <p>
          High-value items are processed in our <strong> Specialty Zone. </strong> These are never cleaned with "bulk" laundry. They undergo pH-neutral cleaning, manual stain treatment, and steam finishing on specialized form-finishers to ensure no shrinkage or loss of embellishment.

      answer: (
        <p>
          For on-site services like sofa or curtain cleaning, our supervisor performs a <strong>  Post-Service Walkthrough </strong> with you. If you are not satisfied with the results, we will re-clean the specific area on the spot or schedule a follow-up visit at no cost. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis if the service fails to meet our technical SOPs.

      question: "Can I track the status of my \"Restoration\" items?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. Unlike local dry cleaners, every item at TLH is barcoded. You can track exactly where your item is—from "In-Processing" to "Final QC"—via our customer portal or by messaging our concierge.
