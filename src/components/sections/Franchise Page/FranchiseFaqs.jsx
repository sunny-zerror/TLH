    question: "What is the typical investment for a TLH Franchise?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The investment varies based on location and store format, typically ranging from ₹1.75-2.5 Cr. This covers the Live Laundry Studio setup, state-of-the-art equipment, initial marketing, and the franchise fee.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How soon can I expect an operational break-even?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The TLH model is designed for rapid stabilization. Most franchise partners achieve operational break-even within approximately 6 months, subject to location performance and execution discipline.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What does \"Self-Reliant & Process-Driven\" mean?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        It means the business is built to run on SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) rather than individual dependencies. We provide the playbook, training, and audits so the store operates at a premium standard even if you are not physically present daily.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is the \"Live Laundry Studio\" concept?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        It is a transparent store layout where customers can see their garments being processed. This \"open-kitchen\" approach builds immense trust, reduces disputes regarding garment handling, and significantly increases walk-in and repeat business.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How is the 14% ROI calculated?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Our target ROI of 14% is based on optimized operating costs and our premium positioning, which allows for higher margins compared to price-driven local competitors. Detailed unit economics are shared during our second-stage discovery call.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Do I need prior experience in the laundry industry?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. We look for partners with business acumen and a commitment to quality. We provide end-to-end training for your staff and management team, along with ongoing operational audits to maintain standards.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Is there a risk of dead-stock or inventory loss?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. Unlike retail, this is a service business with zero inventory management. You do not stock products that might expire or go out of fashion, which ensures a lean balance sheet and minimal working capital risk.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "The Breakeven Model: How do we hit the 6-month target?",
    answer: (
      <>
      <p>Our model is built on reaching a critical mass of <strong> ~2,000 active customers. </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Math:</strong> At a conservative Average Order Value (AOV) of <strong> ₹150, </strong> 2,000 customers stabilize the operational costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Lever:</strong> In Tier-1 catchments (Mumbai/Hyderabad), AOVs often trend toward <strong> ₹200–₹250 </strong> due to high-value items like bridal wear and sneakers. At a ₹250 AOV, your customer acquisition target for breakeven drops by <strong> 40%, </strong> significantly de-risking the first 6 months.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "How is the 2,000-customer acquisition funded?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The initial marketing spend is factored into your <strong>  setup cost.</strong> We don't just give you a brand; we provide a pre-budgeted <strong> Launch Playbook </strong> designed to acquire these initial 2,000 customers through hyper-local digital targeting and catchment-specific activations.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Who bears the liability for garment damage or loss?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Every store operates under a standardized <strong> Liability & Claims Policy. </strong> We provide the SOPs for \"Pre-Processing Inspection\" to identify pre-existing damage. In the rare event of damage caused by our process, the liability is usually capped at a multiple of the service fee or a specific amount (as per industry standards), and we guide you on getting <strong> Business Liability Insurance </strong> to protect your P&L from high-value claims.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Why \"No Inventory\" is a massive advantage for an investor?",
    answer: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unlike a restaurant or retail store where 20-30% of capital is locked in perishables or \"dead stock,\" TLH is a pure service-to-cash model.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your capital stays liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          You pay for consumables (chemicals/packaging) only as you generate revenue.
        </li>
      </ul>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "Can I scale from a single unit to an Area Development model?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. For smart investors, the real ROI is in the \"Cluster Model.\" Once your first unit hits the 6-month breakeven, our system is designed to allow you to open \"Spoke\" units that feed into your existing high-capacity Studio, maximizing your ROI on the initial equipment investment.
      </p>
